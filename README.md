## Project Description
This project is a **Ray Tracing** (Ray Casting) system developed as a web application using **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**. Users can modify various settings to render 3D scenes and view real-time ray tracing results. The system supports reflective surfaces, light sources, and color adjustments.

> [!NOTE]
> This is just a simple simulation!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## Features
- **Advanced Controls**: Users can change resolution, light direction, intensity, and color settings.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: The progress of the render is displayed in real-time.
- **Ray Tracing Algorithm**: The system traces rays through spheres in the scene.
- **Reflection Effects**: Reflective surfaces for objects are supported.

## Requirements
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- JavaScript must be enabled in the browser (enabled by default in most modern browsers).
